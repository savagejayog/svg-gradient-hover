# SVG Hover Animation

[00:00] The video will recreate a hover effect seen on a landing page where an SVG image lights up along the edges when hovered over by the mouse cursor. [░]
[00:28] This tutorial will use ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, but the underlying logic can be applied to other web frameworks or vanilla JavaScript applications. []
[00:42] Before continuing, the video offers a resource for finding web development jobs: webdev jobs.io []
[01:11] ✨ The video sets up a React project using Vite and installs Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and Hero Icons React. [️]
[01:53] Tailwind configuration is adjusted to include specific content from the Tailwind docs (linked in description). []
[03:29] ✨ The card component is styled using Tailwind CSS classes to define dimensions, background color, rounded corners, border, and stroke. [CSS]
[03:42] The stroke for the card is defined outside of the SVG itself to ensure it changes only when hovering over the card, not the SVG. []
[04:10] A Hero Icons component "Circle stack icon" is added inside the card. []
[04:24] ✨ Styling is applied to the icon including size, rounded corners, background color, stroke color, padding, and inner shadow. [CSS]
[04:37] Content is added to the card including a heading ("Database"), and a paragraph. Text styles are applied using Tailwind CSS classes. []
[05:03] ✨ Another section is added to the card with styles applied using Tailwind CSS classes. [CSS]
[05:17] A Hero Icons component "check icon" is added inside the card. []
[05:31] ✅ The styled card with content is displayed in the browser. [✅]
[05:45] ✨ A new div is created to hold the SVG. [CSS]
[05:59] The video recommends searching the Hero Icons website for SVGs to use in the project. []
[06:52] SVG Cleanup We can remove stroke, stroke-width and fill attributes from the SVG as they are defined in the card class. [️]
[07:05] SVG Styling The SVG is styled with width, height, duration and transition for smooth hover effects. [CSS]
[07:33] Path Fill The SVG paths are filled with neutral colors to provide definition. [****]
[07:48] Stroke Gradient A radial gradient named "emerald gradient" is added to define the stroke color. [****]
[08:14] Gradient Stop An emerald green color stop is added to the gradient. [****]
[08:29] Path Stroke The paths reference the "emerald gradient" using URL() to apply the stroke. [****]
[08:45] Second Stop A second stop with neutral 700 color is added to create a highlight effect. [****]
[09:12] Gradient Units The gradient units are set to "user space on use" for easier positioning. [****]
[09:25] Gradient Center The gradient is repositioned to the center of the SVG. [️]
[09:38] Cursor Interaction The CX and Cy attributes will be used to move the gradient with the cursor. [✨]
[10:32] Challenge The challenge is to convert cursor coordinates into percentage values to position the gradient. []
[10:32] Solution Steps The solution involves creating a ref for the card element, tracking cursor coordinates in state, and defining a function to update those coordinates on mouse movement. []
[10:45] Ref and State A ref is created to store the card element and state is created to track cursor X and Y coordinates. []
[10:59] handleMouseMove Function This function is triggered on mouse movement over the card. It retrieves the bounding rectangle of the card element and calculates the X and Y coordinates of the cursor relative to the card. [⚙️]
[11:41] Event Handlers The card section sets the ref to the card ref and the onMouseMove event to handleMouseMove. The flame SVG component receives the cursor and cardRef props. []
[11:54] Flame Component Props The flame component defines props for cursor (an object with X and Y) and cardRef (a ref object). [✨]
[12:22] Flame Component State The flame component uses state to hold the center values (CX and Cy) for the gradient and a useEffect hook to listen for changes in cursor and cardRef. [♻️]
[12:35] useEffect Hook The useEffect hook checks if cardRef is not null and both cursor X and Y have values. It then calculates the CX and Cy percentage values based on cursor position relative to the card's width and height. []
[13:03] Separation of Concerns The calculations are done in the flame component for separation of concerns. [️]
[13:18] Gradient Center Update The gradient center's CX and Cy are set to the calculated percentage values. []
[13:32] Refinement The video suggests adjusting the CX value to achieve a more desired effect. [➡️]
[13:45] Refinement The CX value is adjusted by subtracting 24 to create a more subtle gradient entrance effect on the left side of the card. [➡️]
[14:00] Subtle Hover Effect The radius of the radial gradient is reduced to 35% to make the hover effect more subtle. [**]
[14:14] Complete Hover Effect The hover effect is close to completion with the cursor interaction implemented. [✅]
[14:29] Mouse on Card State A boolean state variable "mouseOnCard" is added to the flame component's props to track whether the cursor is hovering over the card. [✨]
[14:42] Conditional Gradient Rendering The first stop color of the radial gradient is conditionally rendered based on the "mouseOnCard" state. [**]
[14:56] Mouse Events The card section sets event handlers for mouseenter andmouseleave events to update the "mouseOnCard" state. [**]
[15:08] Passing State to Flame Component The "mouseOnCard" state is passed as a prop to the flame component. [➡️]
[15:22] Final Result The final hover effect matches the one seen on the Superbase landing page. [**]
